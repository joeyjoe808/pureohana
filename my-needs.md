 • How many photoshoots do you typically do per month? 

 i go on about 3-5 outside sourced jobs, could be wedding could be just photo shoots, could be candid shots at a beach holiday with an ohana, could be maternity memories, could be a day out in the water on a boat, diving scenes, im an all around portrait/ video guy, i do alot of my own family advantures in order to stay sharp. but ive had more jobs lately. 

 • What's your typical workflow now when delivering photos to clients? 

 what i usually do is ill get a call from someone, ill ask a few questions to get an idea of what they need shot, ill plan and prepare for the day, ill go shoot. when i get home ill bring all of the ssd drives and transfer everything from my cameras sd cards, to my ssd drives where i can edit. than after i scrub through and find the most perfect shots, ill upload to google drive, send a link for others top share, download, and even request further editing on specific shot, i use light room for photos, and i use final cut pro for making videos and films. videos take a bit longer because of the thought process of telling a story, they are also significantly more expensive too. 

 2️⃣ CLIENT EXPERIENCE                                          

When you deliver photos to clients:                                                                   

 • Do they need to see ALL photos or just select ones?  

 usually i send the best of the best through the google drive upload. even edit a little bit too. 

 • Do you do "proofing" where clients pick favorites?     
 
 yes. but i dont "proof everything" only THE BEST SHOTS. perfect focus, perfect composition. 


 • How do clients currently receive photos? (USB drive, Dropbox, email?)                      

 a combination of both, first i send the link, and than they will ask me for a thumbdrive with those pictures or videos saved on it


 • What problems do you have with your current delivery method?         

 its not professional, if i want to make the pictures avalible for printing, i would have to do alot of work making all those arrangements. at least if i had a way where i could send a gallery thst has those features, everything would be avalible through the gallery. prints and all. 
 also when i deliver a video, the first view is through youtube. ill upload and post it there. but this way at least they could view the video in 1080p and request a copy. there i could deliver it in 4k ultra HD.     

   3️⃣ SELLING PRINTS/PRODUCTS                                       

Your e-commerce needs:                                                                                

 • What do you sell? 
 
 photography services. i only deliver downloadable digital prints
                               
 • Do you have set prices or custom quotes?  

 i have set prices for the photography service with digital deliverables. if i were to enable a user to purchase prints, that would be another service i could offer. we would have to fix prices that correspond with the print labs prices, and whatever markup i aski for. 

 • How do you currently handle orders? (manually, through another platform?)         

 i manually handle orders. im trying to make this more automatic and user friendly 


 • Do you ship products yourself or use a print lab?  

 i would use a lab, something like pixiset does where the option to buy a print and frame and even shirts and coffee mugs and puzzles ect ect. is avalible..

                         What frustrates you most about your current process?                         

nothing, ive been using it for years. its free.
what frustrates me the most is i have no ability to build a platform like this where its all in one.

                                         🔟 SUCCESS CRITERIA                                          


                                    The app is "successful" when:              

it works, i can sign in, build a gallery, and send a link to a person, they can view the gallery and like pictures, or even select from images to print and or frame. close to the pixieset client side experience.
