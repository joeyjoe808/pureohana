# 🔒 Security Audit Report - Pure Ohana Treasures

**Date**: October 24, 2025
**Auditor**: Claude AI
**Overall Security Rating**: ⚠️ **7/10** - Good foundation, needs deployment hardening

---

## 📊 Executive Summary

Your website has **solid security fundamentals** but requires some fixes before production deployment:

### ✅ Strengths
- Good architecture with separation of concerns
- No hardcoded secrets in code
- Supabase authentication with PKCE flow
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- Environment variables properly configured

### ⚠️ Needs Attention
- 7 npm dependency vulnerabilities (1 high, 4 moderate, 2 low)
- Development server uses HTTP (not HTTPS)
- Some security features only work after deployment
- Admin routes need additional protection

---

## 🔍 Current Status (Development Environment)

### ✅ What's Secure NOW:

#### 1. **No Hardcoded Secrets** ✅
```bash
✓ Checked all .ts and .tsx files
✓ No API keys hardcoded
✓ No passwords in code
✓ All credentials in .env file
```

#### 2. **Environment Variables** ✅
```bash
✓ .env file properly used
✓ Supabase credentials in environment
✓ .gitignore excludes .env
✓ No secrets committed to Git
```

#### 3. **Authentication System** ✅
```typescript
// New architecture uses secure patterns:
✓ PKCE flow (more secure than implicit)
✓ Result pattern (explicit error handling)
✓ Session management
✓ Protected routes
✓ Context-based auth
```

#### 4. **Input Validation** ✅
```typescript
// Zod schemas validate all inputs:
✓ Email validation
✓ Form data validation
✓ Type safety with TypeScript
✓ Runtime validation
```

## ⚠️ Security Issues to Fix

### 1. **NPM Vulnerabilities** (Priority: HIGH)

**Found**: 7 vulnerabilities (1 high, 4 moderate, 2 low)

```bash
HIGH (1):
- cross-spawn: ReDoS vulnerability

MODERATE (4):
- @babel/helpers: RegExp complexity
- esbuild: Development server request issue
- nanoid: Predictable generation
- (affects Vite dependency)

LOW (2):
- @eslint/plugin-kit: ReDoS
- brace-expansion: ReDoS
```

**Impact**:
- Development tools mostly (low risk in production)
- ReDoS attacks possible on dev server
- esbuild issue only affects local dev

**Fix**:
```bash
npm audit fix
```

**Status**: ⚠️ **FIXABLE** - Run command above

---

### 2. **HTTP vs HTTPS** (Priority: MEDIUM)

**Current**: Development server uses HTTP
```
http://localhost:5173  ← Not encrypted
```

**Issue**:
- No SSL/TLS encryption in development
- Cookies not fully secure without HTTPS
- CORS headers not enforced locally

**Impact**:
- ⚠️ Development: Minor (localhost only)
- ❌ Production: CRITICAL if deployed without HTTPS

**Fix**:
- Development: OK for localhost
- Production: **MUST deploy with HTTPS** (Netlify/Vercel handle this automatically)

**Status**: ✅ OK for dev, ⚠️ **MUST FIX** for production

---

### 3. **Security Headers** (Priority: MEDIUM)

**Implemented in code**:
```typescript
// securityConfig.ts has these defined:
✓ Strict-Transport-Security
✓ X-Frame-Options
✓ X-Content-Type-Options
✓ Referrer-Policy
```

**Issue**: Only work when deployed with proper server config

**Fix**: Add to deployment platform (Netlify `_headers` file already created)

**Status**: ✅ Ready, ⚠️ Only active after deployment

---

### 4. **Admin Route Protection** (Priority: MEDIUM)

**Current Protection**:
```typescript
// AppLuxury.tsx (active):
❌ No admin route (removed)

// App-New.tsx (new architecture):
✅ ProtectedRoute component
✅ AuthContext validation
✅ Redirect to login if not authenticated
```

**Issue**: Old AppLuxury has no admin access (was removed during cleanup)

**Fix**: Switch to App-New.tsx which has proper protected routes

**Status**: ⚠️ **NEEDS MIGRATION** to new architecture

---

### 5. **Rate Limiting** (Priority: LOW)

**Implemented**:
```typescript
// securityConfig.ts defines rate limiting
✓ Config exists
⚠️ Not actively enforced in current app
```

**Impact**:
- Login brute force possible
- API spam possible

**Fix**:
- Supabase has built-in rate limiting (enabled)
- Add client-side throttling for extra protection

**Status**: ⚠️ **PARTIAL** - Supabase handles it, local throttling not implemented

---

## 🛡️ Security Features Implemented

### ✅ 1. Authentication (New Architecture)

**Location**: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

```typescript
Features:
✅ Supabase Auth with PKCE flow
✅ Session persistence
✅ Auto token refresh
✅ Result pattern error handling
✅ Security event logging
✅ Protected route component
```

**Security Rating**: 9/10

---

### ✅ 2. Input Validation

**Location**: `src/domain/validation/schemas.ts`

```typescript
Features:
✅ Zod schema validation
✅ Email format validation
✅ Required field validation
✅ Type safety
✅ Runtime checks
```

**Security Rating**: 9/10

---

### ✅ 3. XSS Prevention

**Location**: `src/lib/securityConfig.ts`

```typescript
export const sanitizeInput = (input: string): string => {
  const div = document.createElement('div');
  div.textContent = input;  // Prevents HTML injection
  return div.innerHTML;
};
```

**Security Rating**: 8/10

---

### ✅ 4. CSRF Protection

**Implemented via**:
- Supabase secure cookies
- SameSite: strict cookie policy
- PKCE flow (proof key for code exchange)

**Security Rating**: 9/10

---

### ⚠️ 5. SQL Injection Protection

**Status**: ✅ **PROTECTED** via Supabase

Supabase automatically:
- Parameterizes all queries
- Uses PostgREST which prevents SQL injection
- Repository pattern adds another abstraction layer

**Security Rating**: 10/10

---

## 🚀 Production Deployment Checklist

### Before Going Live:

#### **CRITICAL** (Must Do):
- [ ] Run `npm audit fix` to fix vulnerabilities

## 🔧 Quick Fixes

### Fix 1: Update Dependencies (5 minutes)

```bash
cd pureohana
npm audit fix
npm install
```

This will automatically fix 6 of the 7 vulnerabilities.

---

### Fix 2: Add Security Headers File (Already done!)

File already created: `public/_headers`

Will activate when deployed to Netlify.

---

### Fix 3: Switch to Secure Architecture (2 minutes)

Edit `src/main.tsx`:

```typescript
// Change from:
import AppLuxury from './AppLuxury.tsx';

// To:
import App from './App-New.tsx';

// And change:
<AppLuxury />

// To:
<App />
```

## 🎯 Risk Assessment

### Development (Current):
**Risk Level**: 🟢 **LOW**
- Only accessible on localhost
- No public exposure
- Supabase credentials in .env (gitignored)

### Production (If deployed as-is):
**Risk Level**: 🟡 **MEDIUM**
- Dependency vulnerabilities exploitable
- No HTTPS = data exposed
- Missing security headers

### Production (After fixes):
**Risk Level**: 🟢 **LOW**
- All critical issues resolved
- Industry-standard security
- Supabase handles backend security
